                <h4>1. What does a loom have to do with Computer Science History?</h4>
                
                <p>Through the development of the loom, Frenchman Joseph Marie Jacquard discovered a simpler method for making fabric designs in 1801. They made numerous cards with holes punched into them that instructed pins on how to be lifted and pulled. The fabric formed an automated pattern by wrapping around itself as the cables were pulled. We came to understand the concept of putting together a series of actions in order to produce or manage something different thanks to the loom. Because of this Charles Baggage used a similar punch program in his Analytical Engine (mechanical computer) to produce more than just mathematical tables, this is crucial for the history of computer science.</p>

                <p>Charles Baggage developed the difference engine in 1821 to make calculations quicker and simpler. He did create a few tiny engine prototypes. A single procedure would then produce a solution when someone registered their data. For data that would be processed later, it had a memory. To make a printing plate, it would print its result on soft metal. Additionally, it is significant for the history of computer science since after this, he had a clearer understanding of the principles underlying the difference engine. Which lead to the analytical engine is a device that can produce many calibrations at once with unmatched accuracy.</p>

            <h4>5. What is the Stored Program?</h4>
            <p>In 1944, John von Neumann initiated the idea that a computer would store instructions in its memory and, when enabled, do a variety of tasks. The information will go in and be translated into 1s and 0s, or binary code, which sends electronic signals on how to represent or store the data. It goes through all the 1s and 0s until you find the information you need. This is significant for computer science history because it makes it possible for hardware and software to talk to each other to manage assets. It is the building block for computers, phones, and any device you would like to hear, watch, and read from.</p>

                <p>Transistors were created by Lucent Technologies in 1947. The Golden Age of Radio came to an end when transistors replaced vacuum tubes by amplifying signals. It resembles a smaller, less-heated electrical switch seen in computers. Numerous circuits in the electronic switch could determine which section was in use. Because it is smaller than a postage stamp, this is significant in the history of computer science. They evolved into minicomputers throughout time and began to take the place of mainframes. Texas Instruments' The First Silicon Transistor introduced it in 1954. In 1956, a new age in which computers occupied less space was established.</p>

                <h4>7. What computer is patented as the first computer?</h4>
                    
                <p>In 1947, J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly filed a patent for the ENIAC, a general-purpose automatic computer, as the first computer. It was invalidated for a couple of reasons, but most importantly because John Atanasoff was said to have built the first automatic electronic digital computer. In 1939, John Atanasoff built a small prototype that could store data and perform addition and subtraction, called an automatic electronic digital computer. While the ENIAC was the first programmed computer, once it was given instructions, it could compute artillery range tables and calculations for the construction of a hydrogen bomb. This is important for computer science history because it gave recognition to John Atanasoff-Berry for building his computer earlier on, and it is a device in the public domain for everyone to use.</p>

            <h4>8. How has AI (artificial intelligence) changed the game?</h4>
            <p>Christopher Strachey used artificial intelligence to construct a full checkers game in 1951. A computerized computer called artificial intelligence can solve problems and find meaning, among other things. This has a significant impact on the history of computer science since colleges now use artificial intelligence more frequently than research-based intelligence. We can now use AI to compose essays and take tests. We use it in the classroom to support one another's learning. Kodezi, an online platform for coding, leverages AI for coding, debugging their code, and quickly responding to concerns about coding. Another is Grammarly, which not only corrects your grammar while you write but also suggests improving sentence structure.

                <p>NASA and DARPA were established in 1957 as a result of the American government's concern over falling behind. To create technologies like as computers, weaponry, and rockets. Led to the notion of creating a "Galactic Network," a means of keeping everyone in contact. To make this concept a reality, universities joined ARPANET. UCLA and Stanford were able to communicate as a result, and UoU became the fourth new node in this new community. This is significant in the history of computer science because they began creating a network that people could use on a daily basis and consequently created the internet.</p>

            <h4>10. Was hypertext ever used before the internet?</h4>
            <p>In 1965, we coined the word hypertext. In 1968, it was Douglas Engelart who took the stage to show how significant hypertext was for jumping from one document to another for presentation. Hypertext is a string used to connect one document to another, searching for a word or phrase. Hypertext was stored in Hypercard, where it was stored information from anything from images, text, and tables. This is essential for computer science history because, on the Macintosh, if you are trying to do research on any kind of subject, the subject will pull up books, magazines, and links in one go. It was hypertext that would take a step further in building the internet.</p>

            <h4>11. When was the first email sent?</h4>
            <p>In 1971, Ray Tomlinson used three programs and the ARPANET to send his first email. It could only be on the same ARPANET network because it was addressed to himself. Many of the early emails, including those from Queen Elizabeth II and SPAM, were sent via ARPANET. Since of how emails were viewed after this development. We still use @ to address people today, this is significant for the history of computer science. When the internet first came online in the 1990s, it was so widely utilized that software was required to separate and sort it from spam emails, dates, searches, and other data.</p>

            <h4>12. When were monitors first used?</h4>
            <p>The Apple I was the first personal computer that individuals could connect to a video monitor in 1976. A few years earlier, they discovered they could utilize phosphors to produce a vacuum tube that would generate light when struck by electrons. It was, however, enormous and heavy. This is significant in the history of computer science because it was necessary to go past that period to develop compact liquid crystal displays, which are energy-efficient screens. After that time, another field, like head-mounted displays (VR), can enter the picture.</p>

            <h4>13. When was Mobile Apps born?</h4>
            <p>IBM unveiled the world's first general-use phone in 1993, together with a calculator, calendar, contact list, and clock. However, it wasn't until Apple opened their APP Store in 2008—which included games, productivity applications, and many more. That we started to see developers create creative apps. This is crucial for the history of computer science because we then pursue Android operating systems and software development kits to release additional apps for innovation, efficiency, education, wellness, streaming services, for communities that were established not just in the United States but also around the globe.</p>

            <h4>14. When were web browsers first used?</h4>
            <p>Tim Berners-Lee developed the first browser in 1990, launching the World Wide Web. Links between them were present. Through a search bar, customers would be able to ask for everything they might need and then return to the navigation. This sparked browser wars to see who could add additional capabilities beyond allowing images to be embedded in text, which is significant for the history of computer science. Microsoft began claiming a market share advantage of 50% against Netscape. Apple Safari and Chrome replaced browsers on desktops and mobile applications as time passed.  They are still competing to see who is quicker while offering the market with a better experience.</p>            <h4>Citation</h4>
