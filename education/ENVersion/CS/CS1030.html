                <h4>1. What does a loom have to do with Computer Science History?</h4>
                
                <p>In 1801, Frenchman Joseph Marie Jacquard demonstrated an easier way to create patterns for fabric through the invention of the loom. They created multiple punched cards with holes that told pins how they should be raised and pulled. Through the pulling of cords, the fabric wrapped around itself, creating an automated pattern. The loom made us realize the analogy of creating a sequence of operations to create or control something different. This is significant for computer science history because it inspired Charles Baggage to use a similar punch program in his Analytical Engine (mechanical computer) to create more than mathematical tables.</p>

                <p>In 1821, Charles Baggage thought of the idea of the difference engine to help create calculations faster and easier. He did build small prototypes of the engine. Someone would register their data, and then a single operation would take place and produce a solution. It had a memory for data to be processed later. It would print its output on soft metal to produce a printing plate. Likewise, it is important for computer science history because, after this, he had a better idea of the foundations of the difference engine. A machine to create more than one calibration at a time with unprecedented accuracy, the analytical engine.</p>

                <p>In 1843, Ada Lovelace translated and annotated an article written by the Italian Luigi Federico Menabrea. She analyzed a couple of things, including how the analytical engine could program various answers for computing Bernoulli numbers. Shows that the computer is working and how powerful this engine is. This connects to the next point, that the sequence of operations is separate from the date and results. Showing it could do more and describing artificial intelligence before its time. This is essential for computer science history because she was able to read words beyond the screen and connect software with hardware.</p>

                <h4>4. What was the Hollerith Machine</h4>

                <p>In 1880, the census took seven years to count, and everyone was fed up with taking the time. So, Herman Hollerith, who worked for the 1880 census, invented a punch card tally machine. Installed in federal government offices in 1888. Where people would punch in their data. Then, tabulation started reading the holes in each section. Thereafter, the clerk transcribed the data in his hands and put it in a designated sorter drawer. They would process 80 punch cards per minute. In 1890, the census was completed in two weeks. This is significant for computer science history because it brought in a new age of automatic data processing. In trying to analyze the data, it took months, then weeks, and now maybe seconds.</p>

            <h4>5. What is the Stored Program?</h4>
            <p>In 1944, John von Neumann initiated the idea that a computer would store instructions in its memory and, when enabled, do a variety of tasks. The information will go in and be translated into 1s and 0s, or binary code, which sends electronic signals on how to represent or store the data. It goes through all the 1s and 0s until you find the information you need. This is significant for computer science history because it makes it possible for hardware and software to talk to each other to manage assets. It is the building block for computers, phones, and any device you would like to hear, watch, and read from.</p>

                <p>In 1947, transistors were invented by Lucent Technologies. Transistors amplify a signal, thus replacing vacuum tubes and ending the Golden Age of Radio. It is like an electronic switch in a computer that heats less and is smaller. The electronic switch had many circuits that could tell which area was active. This is important for computer science history because it is smaller than a postage stamp. Over time, they became minicomputers and started replacing mainframes. It was first seen in 1954 in The First Silicon Transistor from Texas Instruments. That establishing of a new era in 1956 where computers take less space.</p>

                <h4>7. What computer is patented as the first computer?</h4>
                    
                <p>In 1947, J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly filed a patent for the ENIAC, a general-purpose automatic computer, as the first computer. It was invalidated for a couple of reasons, but most importantly because John Atanasoff was said to have built the first automatic electronic digital computer. In 1939, John Atanasoff built a small prototype that could store data and perform addition and subtraction, called an automatic electronic digital computer. While the ENIAC was the first programmed computer, once it was given instructions, it could compute artillery range tables and calculations for the construction of a hydrogen bomb. This is important for computer science history because it gave recognition to John Atanasoff-Berry for building his computer earlier on, and it is a device in the public domain for everyone to use.</p>

            <p>In 1951, Christopher Strachey programmed a complete game of checkers using artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a digital computer that performs tasks like discovering meaning, problem-solving, and many more. This is influential for computer science history because, in today's age, we are using artificial intelligence in universities more than research-based intelligence. Now, we can write essays and take tests with AI. In education, we use it to help each other learn. The online coding platform Kodezi uses AI for coding, debugging their code, and answering questions about coding in seconds. Another is Grammarly, which uses it to correct grammar when writing but also shows you better ways to write your sentence.</p>

                <p>In 1957, the U.S. government had a fear of falling behind, which created NASA and DARPA. To develop technologies like rockets, weapons, and computers. led to the idea of building a “Galactic Network,” a way for everyone to stay in communication. Universities joined ARPANET to make this idea a reality. This led to communication between UCLA and Stanford, and UoU was the fourth new community and node. This is important for computer science history because they started building a network, so civilians could use it for everyday use, and they built the internet.</p>

            <h4>10. Was hypertext ever used before the internet?</h4>
            <p>In 1965, we coined the word hypertext. In 1968, it was Douglas Engelart who took the stage to show how significant hypertext was for jumping from one document to another for presentation. Hypertext is a string used to connect one document to another, searching for a word or phrase. Hypertext was stored in Hypercard, where it was stored information from anything from images, text, and tables. This is essential for computer science history because, on the Macintosh, if you are trying to do research on any kind of subject, the subject will pull up books, magazines, and links in one go. It was hypertext that would take a step further in building the internet.</p>

            <p>In 1971, Ray Tomlinson sent his first email in 1971 using ARPANET and three programs. It was addressed to himself and can only be on the same ARPANET network. Through ARPANET, many first emails were sent, like Queen Elizabeth II and SPAM emails. This is important for computer science history because it evolved how emails were seen, and until today we still use @ to address the person. In the 1990s, it was so widely used at the birth of the internet that they needed to build software to separate and sort it from spam emails, dates, searching, and so on.</p>

            <h4>12. When were monitors first used?</h4>
            <p>In 1976, the Apple I was the first computer that people could plug into a video monitor. A couple of years before, they realized they could use a vacuum tube with phosphors to emit light when it was hit by electrons. However, it was enormous and bulky. This is critical for computer science history because we needed to pass that era to get to liquid crystal displays for portable use, which are extremely energy-efficient, thin displays. Following this, a new area, such as head-mounted displays (VR), may come into play.</p>

            <h4>13. When was Mobile Apps born?</h4>
            <p>In 1993, IBM introduced its first phone to the world for general use, like a calculator, calendar, contact book, and clock. However, not until 2008 did we see developers build innovative apps because Apple released their APP Store with games, productivity tools, and many more. This is essential for computer science history because we then pursue Android operating systems and software development kits to put more apps out there for creativity, productivity, education, wellness, streaming services, and communities that were built not only in the U.S. but around the world.</p>

            <h4>14. When were web browsers first used?</h4>
            <p>In 1990, the first browser was created by Tim Berners-Lee, creating the World Wide Web. It was connected through hyperlinks. It was to allow clients to request anything they would want through a search bar and be able to go back to navigation. This is important for computer science history because it stated browser wars to see which can bring new capabilities beyond allowing images embedded in text. Microsoft started claiming 50% of the market over Netscape. Over the years, Apple Safari took over mobile applications and Chrome on the desktop. They are still running to see who is faster and gives a better experience to the market.</p>
