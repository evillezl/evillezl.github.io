            <h3>Brief Summary</h3>
            <p>In this module, we will research the history of computer science. We will analize many (14) interesting questions about computer history. 
                For each question we will discuss, when did it happened? who played their part? what happened? and, why this is simportant 
                in the history of computer science?

                <h4>What does a loom have to do with Computer Science History?</h4>
                
                <p>In 1801, Frenchman Joseph Marie Jacquard demonstrated an easier way to create patterns for fabric, through the invention of the Loom. 
                 They created multiple punched card with holes, that told pins how they should be raised and pulled. 
                Through the pulling of cords, the fabric wrapped around created an automated pattern. The loom made us realize
                the analogy of creating a Squence of Operations to create or control something different. This is important for computer science history
                because it inspired Charles Baggage to use a similar punch program in his Analytical Engine (mechanical computer) 
                to create more than mathamatical tables. </p>

            <h3>1821</h3>
                <h4>Did the Difference Engine ever work?</h4>
                
                <p>In 1821, Charles Baggage thought of the idea of the difference engine to help create caculations faster and easier. 
                    He did build small protoypes of the engine. Someone would register their data, then a single operation will take place and it will 
                    produce a solution. It had a memory for data to be processed for later. Including, it would print its output on soft 
                    metal to produce a printing plate. It is important for computer science histroy because after this 
                    he concieved a better idea with the foundations of the difference engine. A machine to create more than one caculation 
                    at a time with unprecedented accuracy, the Analytical Engine.

            <h3>1843</h3>
                <h4>Who is Ada Lovelace?</h4>
                
                <p>In 1843, Ada Lovelace translated and annotate an article written by Italian Luigi Federico Menabrea. She analized a couple of things,
                    how the Analytical Engine could program various answers for computing Bernoulli numbers. Shows that the the computer is working and how powerful this engine is.
                    This connects to the next point that the Squence of Operations, is seperate from the date and results. Showing it could do more, 
                    and describing artificial intelligence before its time. This is important for computer science history because she was able to read 
                    words beyond the screen, and connecting software with hardware.</p>
