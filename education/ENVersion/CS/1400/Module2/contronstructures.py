#Keeping track of score Example
score = 0
print ("Score:", score)
#Wins 1
score += 1
print ("Score:", score)
#Wins 5
score += 5
print ("Score:", score)
#Loses 1
score -= 1
print ("Score:", score)

#Digit of Binary Example

binary *= 2
print (binary, end = "")

print (binary, end = "")
binary *= 2
print (binary, end = "")
binary *= 2
print (binary, end = "")
binary *= 2
print (binary, end = "")
binary *= 2

#if Statements
 #if: it is true or false
    #skips statements that are false
 #else: executes what the condition is if it is true
 #elif: runs the first true statement
 #or: returns if one of the statements are true
 #and: returns if all of the statements are true
